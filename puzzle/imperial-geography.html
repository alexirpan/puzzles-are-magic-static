    At one point in time, it controlled territory in nearly every zone of the planet!"</p>

<ul>
<li>Speedy invasion of this colony by an enemy empire allowed it to invade the Empire's crown jewel by land, but the Empire defeated that invasion and later reconquered this colony.</li>

<li>Furthest North provincial (not territorial) capital in the Empire's oldest Dominion.</li>
<li>Underpopulated and remote island that may sometimes be confused for the state within a country that successfully rebelled against the Empire, or the country bordering the largest country and a colored sea.</li>
<li>This island in the Empire's oldest Dominion contains a provincial capital and shares its name with its province's most populous city.</li>
<li>City equidistant from the West and East Coasts of the Empire's oldest Dominion, which is also the capital and by far the most populous city in its province.</li>
<li>This major trading port controls a vital shipping lane between two oceans and was the site of one of the Empire's greatest surrenders.</li>
<li>Island located in the center of the Middle Sea that was the base for the Empire's fleet in said sea.</li>
<li>Many islands comprise this territory of the Empire's antipodal Dominion, and these islands are named after the Empire's famous explorer of the largest ocean.</li>
<li>Even though it is the most populous city in the Empire's continental Dominion and the capital of its most populous state, it is not the capital of the Dominion.</li>
<li>Off the coast of the Empire's crown jewel, this strategic island was used to base one of the Empire's fleets during a major war.</li>
<li>Formerly the most populous and now the second most populous city in the Empire's oldest Dominion, and one that speaks the language of the Empire's greatest rival.</li>
<li>First overseas colony of the Empire, this aptly named island took a long time to join its neighboring Dominion.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, this archipelago was jointly ruled by a condominium between the Empire and its greatest rival.</li>
<li>Essentially a giant rock, this territory was seized from an Imperial rival, and was used by the Empire used to guard the entry into a major sea.</li>
<li>Though not an Imperial territory, but owned by its oldest ally, this island group was used by the Empire to secure passage through its ocean in a major war.</li>
<li>Small country which borders the Empire's crown jewel and is the source of a famous (or infamous) class of soldiers.</li>
