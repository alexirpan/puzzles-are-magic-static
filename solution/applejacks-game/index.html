<div>
    <p>This puzzle is inspired by the board game <em>Apples to Apples</em>, or at
    least its fictional pony equivalent of <em>Applejacks to Applejacks</em>
    that we made up for this puzzle.
    When <span class="monospace">finalexam</span> is entered as a command, you're told that there are
    five missing cards, and you need to enter which card each pony would pick.
    This splits the puzzle into two parts:
    finding the rule each pony uses to pick their favorite card, and determining
    the missing cards. These parts can be solved
    independently.</p>

    <h2>Part 1: Pony Rules</h2>

    <p>In each round of <em>Applejacks to Applejacks</em>, each pony mentions her
    favorite card of that round, including any cards that were tied for her
    favorite. Additionally, the judge of each round is asked to briefly
    explain why she picked the card she did. The winning pony is randomly
    picked from all ponies that haven't won yet, guaranteeing that solvers
    see each pony's explanation once after 6 rounds of play.</p>

    <p>Below are the explanations each pony gives, and the corresponding rule,
    which can be verified by generating a few rounds and verifying they're
    consistent with the data received.</p>

    <table class="table table-condensed">
        <thead>
            <tr><th>Pony</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Rule</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Applejack</td>
                <td>"It really took the lead."</td>
                <td>Card that comes first alphabetically.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Twilight Sparkle</td>
                <td>"It reminded me of reading a nice, long book."</td>
                <td>Card with the longest name.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Rainbow Dash</td>
                <td>"It was the most colorful."</td>
                <td>Card with the most unique letters from ROYGBIV. Multiple instances of the same letter only count once.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Fluttershy</td>
                <td>"It reminded me of the tea parties I like to have at home."
                <td>Card with the most Ts.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Rarity</td>
                <td>"It was rarer than the other ones."</td>
                <td>Card with the rarest letter, as defined by US Scrabble value.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Pinkie Pie</td>
                <td>"It reminded me of queueing, and voodoo, and sequoias and iguanas!"</td>
                <td>Card with the highest fraction of vowels (letters in AEIOU).</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Each pony's rule is either thematic to their name, or is well satisfied by their own name out of the Mane 6, but noticing this isn't needed to solve the puzzle.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: Finding the Missing Cards</h2>

    <p>There are a limited number of red cards and green cards, and you're told
    when Applejack needs to shuffle each deck. Some notetaking will show that
    there are 35 red cards and 5 green cards.</p>

<p>(Appleloosa Ponies isn't 100% accurate, since the set includes some buffalo, and Bloomberg the apple tree. However, we felt that PONIES was the collective noun solvers would think of first, and a slightly-incorrect noun was better than a rarer 100%-correct one.)</p>

    <p>For each group, there is a notable apple cultivar that also appears in that
    group. There are hundreds of these cultivars, but the ones used are well known
    and all appear on <a href="https://bestapples.com/varieties-information/varieties/">bestapples.com</a>'s list of apple varieties. They used to also all appear on the
    <a href="https://www.usapple.org/apple-varieties">US Apple Association</a>
    website, but they updated their website between puzzle construction and
    the public run of the hunt.
    In testsolving, common break-ins were realizing FUJI was both an apple
    and a Japanese mountain, or looking up a list of Mike Doughty's albums and noticing one
    was titled GOLDEN DELICIOUS.</p>

    <table class="table table-condensed">

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Appleloosa Ponies</td><td>BRAEBURN</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Audio Manufacturers</td><td>MCINTOSH</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Japanese Mountains</td><td>FUJI</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mike Doughty Albums</td><td>GOLDEN DELICIOUS</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Music Genres</td><td>JAZZ</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>For Appleloosa Ponies in particular, several ponies from the Apple
    family are named after apple cultivars, but only Braeburn lives in
    Appleloosa.</p>

    <h2>Solving the Puzzle</h2>

    <p>Applying the discovered rules to the five apple cultivars gives
    <span class="monospace">BRAEBURN, GOLDEN DELICIOUS, GOLDEN DELICIOUS, MCINTOSH, JAZZ, FUJI</span>. Entering this for <span class="monospace">finalexam</span> gives one final message.</p>

<div class="row">
<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 monospace">Correct!</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 monospace">
    In another flash of light, one final card appears.
    <br>
    It reads "The ANSWER you seek lies at the LONG BRANCH SALOON."
</p>
</div>

    <p>The answer is <strong>LONG BRANCH SALOON</strong>.</p>

<p>This puzzle started with Nishant noticing we could
make an <em>Apples to Apples</em> puzzle.
In the first draft, solvers needed to transform a list of words
such that they fit <em>Apples to Apples</em> categories,
with extraction coming from the transformation.</p>

<p>This didn't capture the spirit of <em>Apples to Apples</em> as
much as it could have, so we revised it to the current interactive
version where each judge had different preferences.
Initialy, there was no "missing card" step, and finding each
rule solved the puzzle, but testsolvers rightfully pointed out that
all the red cards were unused information.
They proposed the missing card step, but we were stuck on a satisfying
choice for the missing cards.
Eventually, we realized it
would be very fitting if the missing cards were apples, leading to the final version.
Small tweaks were made to ensure each apple was somepony's favorite, there
were no ties, and each pony's rule was thematic to their name or would
select their name.</p>

<p>For music genres, we caught the Polka apple in testsolving, but during the
hunt a few solvers found the Flamenco apple. That was a bit unfortunate, but
Jazz was the more common apple cultivar, and it looks like solvers
powered through the ambiguity.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with where this puzzle ended up.
The lesson here is that the best way to write an apple-themed puzzle is
to continually ask "What if we add EVEN MORE APPLES?"</p>
