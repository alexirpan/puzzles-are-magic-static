    <p>This puzzle shares its name with the My Little Pony song "Art of the Dress", but
    it's not about that song. Instead, it's literally art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">The Dress</a>.</p>

    <p>Every 10 seconds, the colors in the dress shift from white-and-gold stripes
    to blue-and-black stripes. The bottom of the dress stand has Morse code,
    which decodes to PANTONE.</p>

    <p>This indicates we should lookup the Pantone color name for each color.
    The color names are all from Pantone's cotton section, as hinted in the
    flavortext.
    Extracting the exact colors of the white-and-gold version and the blue-and-black
    version, and looking up the Pantone color name for each, we see that the
    non-color portion of each name has the same length, and they overlap at exactly
    one letter.</p>

    <p>Reading down the dress from top to bottom gives PARTISAN.
    Submitting this tells your team to send an email to <tt>puzzlesaremagic+thedress@gmail.com</tt>,
    where the subject is either "White and Gold" or "Blue and Black". Sending
    either subject gave solvers this reply.</p>

    <p>First, the important part. The votes are in, and 253 votes later, we
    can finally settle what color The Dress is.</p>

    <p align="center">
        <img style="width:100%;" src="../../puzzle_resources/art-of-the-dress/votes.png">
    </p>

    <p>For the record, I picked an extraction that avoided making a
    value judgment on the color of the dress, but I'm <em>firmly</em> in the
    White and Gold camp. These results disgust me.</p>

    <p>On to the puzzle! I had a very hard time coming up with a Rarity puzzle. I did a lot of
    research on gemstones, hairstyles, and details of dress making, but wasn't
    able to find a puzzle idea I was happy with.</p>

    <p>While watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2s1I_U8xSw">Art of the Dress</a>
    for the 14th time to see if there were any
    interesting visuals or lyrics I could pull from the song, I idly thought that
    one famous dress was The Dress, and wouldn't it be funny if the puzzle was
    literally artwork of The Dress?
    The rest of the puzzle came together almost immediately.
    I tried to avoid using Pantone colors, but Web colors didn't have
    enough shades of white, gold, blue, and black to work with.</p>

    <p>As you may have noticed during hunt, getting exact hex colors from an
    animation to solvers is harder than you'd think! The first testsolve used
    GIF, but GIF does lossy compression if you use more than 256 different colors
    across the entire animation, so that didn't work.
    After some searching, WebP seemed like the best
    supported image format that supported both animations and lossless
    compression.</p>

    <p>That worked fine the next 2 testsolves, until a team decided to take
    a screenshot of the animation instead of using a GIF exploder like
    <a href="https://ezgif.com/">ezGIF</a> (which, despite its name, supports WebP
    images). After a long Q&amp;A session,
    we figured out that on some machines, but not all, screenshots would slightly
    change the pixel values, and unfortunately, some Pantone colors only differ
    by 1 in a single RGB channel, so the exact pixel values were important.
    Out of exasperation I gave them the
    intended images directly...and they still got the wrong data.</p>

    <p>After <em>another</em> Q&amp;A session, I found out they were using
    <a href="https://imagecolorpicker.com/">imagecolorpicker.com</a>, one of
    the first search results for getting colors out of an image.
    In its backend, the site converts all uploaded images to JPEG,
    even if they were initially in a lossless format like PNG, so the
    colors that come back to you don't match the original ones.</p>

    <p>At this point, perhaps the puzzle should have been cut...but every testsolver
    who didn't hit these color issues thought the puzzle was really cute, and
    I was a big fan of the "email to vote" interaction.
    I settled for adding as much warning as I could, without ruining the parts
    of the puzzle I found elegant.</p>

    <p>Given a do-over, I would have provided both the animation, and smaller
    download links for the two dresses. Extracting the correct color
    values was not supposed to be the hard part of the puzzle.</p>

    <p>It also didn't help that Pantone's hex-to-color tool sometimes
    recommends a color that doesn't match the color exactly, over a color
    that <em>does</em> match exactly. The correct color is always in the list
    of options, but I have no idea how you could even code an error like that...</p>

    <p>In short, we're sorry if you got hit by any of these issues. The lesson
    here is that exact colors are horribly complicated, and elegant ideas
    don't always lead to elegant results.</p>
