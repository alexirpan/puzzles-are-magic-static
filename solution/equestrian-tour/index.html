    <p>Each puzzle answer corresponds to a real-world location. However,
    this puzzlehunt isn't taking place in our world. It's taking place in the
    world of Equestria! Each of these real-world locations has a horse-punned
    name in the MLP universe.

    <table class="table table-condensed">
        <thead>
            <tr><th>Answer</th><th>Real Location</th><th>MLP Location</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tr><td>GREEN BOOTS</td><td>Mount Everest</td><td>Mount Everhoof</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MAID OF THE MIST</td><td>Niagara Falls</td><td>Neighagra Falls</td></tr>

    </table>

    <p>The flavor text, as well as the odd spacing and different sizing of the question
    marks and arrows, should clue the final step: looking up a world
    map of Equestria. There are a few such world maps, but the one used in the puzzle
    is the 2015 version that appears on the MLP wiki's <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Equestria">Equestria page.</a></p>

    <p>By resizing and overlaying the given image on the map, we can get the question marks to
    line up with the six place names, the gray dots to line up with the names
    of other Equestrian locations, and the star to lie on top of the star
    atop Twilight's Castle, the location everypony meets at when the story begins.</p>

        <img style="width:100%" src="../../puzzle_resources/equestrian-tour/meta1solutionfinalversion.png">
    </p>

    <p>There are six red boxes, close to the names of the six horse-punned
    locations for the puzzle answers.
    Indexing into the puzzle answer with the red numbers, and into the place
    locations with the black numbers, gives the cluephrase PLACE BIGGER ON THE
    INSIDE, which solves to <strong>TARDIS.</strong></p>

    <p>This meta went through several rounds of testsolving before reaching its
    final state. It started as a pure meta with an entirely different
    mechanic, but it testsolved too hard and no one got it.
    Every testsolver who figured out the horse-punned cities mentioned trying to
    plot them on a world map, so I decided to follow suit and make the puzzle
    work the way solvers wanted it to.</p>

    <p>Annoyingly, the source material isn't consistent on the spellings
    of Equestrian locations, but luckily that isn't too important to the puzzle.
    However, this did have an unexpected side effect. The horse-punned
    version of Las Vegas is Las Pegasus in the show and most MLP media,
    but on the official
    Equestria map, it's spelled as Los Pegasus. Many teams thought Los Pegasus
    was a pun for Los Angeles (it's right next to Applewood!),
    and they sent many, many fruitless backsolve attempts
    of Los Angeles locations instead of Las Vegas ones.</p>

    <p>The first version of this puzzle clued the Equestria world map
    less strongly, but it ended up being ambiguous which map to use, so more
    hints were added over time.</p>

    <p>Including Twilight's Castle in the path was a last-minute addition, but
    it was
    clearly the correct choice story-wise. I got lucky that we noticed this
    before any regular puzzles were written, since the new path needed to visit
    different cities to work out.</p>

    <p>The path was constructed to use at least 1 letter from each puzzle
    answer, but to use letters from the map when possible instead.
    One unfortunate side effect is that the feeder answers don't contribute
    much to the cluephrase, but the alternative was worse: when I used more
    answer letters, nutrimatic had a
    very, very easy time retriving "PLACE BIGGER ON THE INSIDE" without
    the map at all!
    I wrote a program to find
    the minimal valid solution that worked with a list of puzzle answers
    I was okay with.</p>

    <p>I tried to get Vanhoover into the path, since
    <em>My Little
        Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> was produced in Vancouver, but it was too
    hard to do so while meeting the constraints of a good path. Oh well.</p>
