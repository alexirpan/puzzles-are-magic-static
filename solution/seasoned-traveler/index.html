    <p>
        This puzzle is made of
        24 large images, as well as one small image at the bottom.
        First, identify the episodes each large image comes from, tracking both
        the season (see the puzzle title, <em>Season</em>ed Traveler) and the episode number.
        To help verify IDing, the seasons of the episodes go "1111 2222 4444 5555 6666 7777".
    </p>

    <p>
        The final image is of a pony named "Count Caeser". Notably, the puzzle skips Season
        3 of My Little Pony, the only season with 13 episodes. Every other
        season has 26 episodes, suggesting conversion to letters A to Z.
    </p>

    <p>
        Solvers who have watched My Little Pony will likely recognize that
        every puzzle answer appears in the title of exactly one My Little Pony
        episode - when possible, we picked episodes that were popular in the
        fandom. Solvers unfamiliar with My Little Pony were expected
        to discover this during the image IDing process.

        Take the four images for each season, convert them to letters, shift

        season, and read in order to get the answer
        <strong>THE RETURN OF NIGHTMARE MOON</strong>.

<p>The story of this hunt is that the Mane 6 are first trying to find
<em>where</em> a friendship problem is, and then <em>when</em> a
friendship problem is. Accordingly, I wanted the first metapuzzle
to be about space, and the second metapuzzle to be about time.
</p>

<p>For the second meta, the initial plan was to use events from the
My Little Pony calendar, but then I learned that didn't exist.
There are fan timelines, some of which are eerily specific,
like
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Nf6WRf5vhQf72oWdq3F6YoNORrw7xmcx7vi0vYSWnQ/edit">this one by @DrewFlashy1 and @TheBronyCritic</a>, which cross-references lunar cycles in
the show to estimate the exact date and chronological order of every episode in
the series. However, there are no canonical dates to work with.
</p>

<p>In their place, I made this metapuzzle based on specific
episodes, which was close enough to a puzzle about time.
The first version of this meta gave
images in "124567 124567 124567 124567" order, but the partial cluephrases
were very bad if you had mistakes in identified episodes.
Each image is taken directly from the MLP wiki's episode gallery,
which makes it easy to confirm, but reverse image searches
turned up many false positives, even when I tried to use unambiguous
images.
Grouping by season made it easier for
solvers to catch their own mistakes.</p>

<p>This puzzle used to have the answer THE NIGHT THAT LASTS FOREVER, but
on a whim I changed it to THE RETURN OF NIGHTMARE MOON.
This turned out that was a good idea, because a few
solvers guessed THE NIGHT THAT LASTS FOREVER from just the flavor.
</p>

<p>This metapuzzle is incredibly easy to backsolve, and in fact it's
solvable with 0 puzzles, by trying different shifts until the blocks
of letters give valid English.
At design time, I felt this was okay. It was the last meta of the hunt,
backsolving didn't give any hunt progression, and it also didn't make
the meta any easier, since the work in this puzzle comes from grinding
through episode IDing.
After the meta was finalized, we ended up reusing the answers one last
time in Elements War, and at that point the easy backsolving was more
problematic, but it was too late to change things.</p>

<p>
Several teams figured out the episode connection before
unlocking the metapuzzle, and theoretically, a team could have decided to
brute-force all the unique episode words to unlock the meta, instead
of solving the puzzles. No team actually did this, but the fact it was
possible wasn't great, and in hindsight I would have added more layers to
the puzzle to make the answers more important to extraction and
less backsolvable. A bunch of teams brute-forced backsolves <em>after</em>
unlocking the meta, but I had no problem with that. My argument is
that in practice, backsolves are directed towards puzzles that the
team doesn't want to do, so if you make the backsolve harder, it
doesn't make the forward solve any more likely. They'll just abandon
the puzzle instead, and this is especially true for metas near the
end of hunt.
