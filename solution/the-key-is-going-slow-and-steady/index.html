         <em>

    Solvers are given a slide deck titled
    "Fluttershy's Guide to Whether an Animal Makes a Good Pet", as well as the images
    of 8 animals. Spoiler alert: according to Fluttershy, every animal makes
    a good pet.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point, solvers who know My Little Pony should immediately
    be reminded of the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBcqWRaJ4eQ">"Find a Pet"</a>
    song from the Season 2 episode "May the Best Pet Win!". Solvers who
    don't know MLP will have to figure out the connection from other context
    clues: the given animals are screenshots from the song, the flavortext
    "express my delight" and "the pet that will suit them just right"
    is taken verbatim from the song, and the puzzle in general hints at
    pets very strongly.
    </p>

    <p>
    The slide deck itself is a
    <a href="https://oregonstate.edu/trees/dichotomous_key.html">dichotomous key</a>,
    which identifies species based on a series of Yes/No questions.
    There are 26 endpoints in the dichotomous key, and treating
    No as 0 and Yes as 1, the path to these leaves correspond to the binary
    for numbers 1 to 26. Start by taking the 8 given animals and
    sending them through the
    key, converting the binary numbers to letters.
    </p>

    <p>
        The exact animal name solvers should use is the name used in the lyrics
        of "Find a Pet".
        Alternate names that gives the same results are included in the table
        as well.

    The eight given animals give PETS LEFT, matching the first given boxes.
    Many animals are featured in the episode "May the Best Pet Win!", but
    for the puzzle, we specifically want the pets mentioned in "Find a Pet".
    Going through the lyrics, there are 16 pets mentioned by name.
    Eight were used to give the
    PETS LEFT phrase, and these pets were given in the order they appear
    in the lyrics. The other eight pets, in song order, are:
    puddy tat (cat), otter, seal, ladybug, cricket, owl, toucan, and
    flamingo.

    This gives IRARGVNA, which is garbage, but as indicated with the given boxes,
    we still need to rotate (Caeser shift) by an appropriate number.
    One notable pet that isn't mentioned in "Find a Pet", but which features
    prominently in "May the Best Pet Win!", is Tank the tortoise, the pet
    that ultimately wins Rainbow Dash's competition. Although Tank is sometimes
    called a turtle, the script for "Find a Pet" is very adamant that he
    is a tortoise. The puzzle title says "The Key is Going Slow and Steady",
    so we should send "tortoise" through the key, to get the amount to shift
    by.

    Rotating the letters by 13 gives the final answer, <strong>VENETIAN</strong>.
    Alternatively, you can just brute-force the 26 possible shifts.

Alex: Most of the ideas for this puzzle came from the anonymous contributor.
They didn't know any My Little Pony, and since we needed a Fluttershy puzzle,
I suggested theming it after "Find a Pet", and it went from there.
</p>

<p>
The letter-rotating step was primarily done to fit Tank into the puzzle,
since he's the point of the entire episode. As a side
benefit, it spread the animals over more of the alphabet, which made the
dichotomous key easier to build. As much as possible, I wanted the
Yes/No questions to be based on the animal, rather than their name,
especially because the names were ambiguous before solvers figured out
the "Find a Pet" connection. I wasn't able to do this all the way, but
I'm happy I was able to bring it down to just 2 questions based on spelling
instead of semantics.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, one side effect was that TORTOISE was also an 8-letter phrase.
During the hunt, many solvers wanted to treat TORTOISE as a Vigenere cipher
key to shift each of the 8 leftover pets by a different value.
We didn't catch this in testsolving because every testsolve group
brute-forced all 26 shifts first, solving the final step immediately.
Some solvers also interpreted "Rotate" as "anagram". The ciphertext of
"IRARGVNA" is very close to an anagram of VIRGINIA, if you assume you have
a few errors.
</p>

<p>
Given a do-over, I would probably just remove Tank from the puzzle. It's
unfortunate from an MLP perspective, but it makes the solve cleaner.
</p>

<p>
With an 8 letter clue phrase, even a few errors could make the message
unreadable, so we added the "not supposed to get here" labels
to every letter that shouldn't be reached. Here are some examples that
we designed the dichotomous key to catch.

<p>Unfortunately, some names (like "yellowjacket") weren't caught by this,
but the letters become distinctive once the song connection is found.
</p>

<p>
I was concerned that telling solvers the letters used would enable a shortcut to the puzzle:
check all letters that are used, build an appropriate regex of length 8, and
see what words match. After some discussion with testsolvers, we
decided the Caeser shifting made this too difficulty,
or at least, hard enough that we were okay with solvers finishing
the puzzle that way.
</p>

<p>(Incidentally, in the alternate universe where we didn't Caeser shift VENETIAN, a regex search for 8 letters all inside <span class="monospace">[PETSLEFTVENETIAN]</span> would find VENETIAN at the
<a href="https://nutrimatic.org/?q=%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D%5Bpetsleftvenetian%5D&go=Go">11th full word of nutrimatic results</a>, so our fears weren't entirely unfounded.)</p>

<p>
Factchecking the dichotomous key was pretty time consuming, and while doing so,
we learned many fun facts about animals.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bunnies are not daytime creatures (diurnal), nor are they nighttime
    creatures (nocturnal). They're twilight creatures (crepuscular).</li>
<li>Ladybugs are not nocturnal, but the top Google search result incorrectly
    describes them as nocturnal, due to using the wrong definition.</li>
<li>Rabbits do not eat wood, but they do chew on wood pellets.</li>
<li>Hummingbirds have been spotted digging through wood ashes, and may even
eat wood ashes, as a source of calcium and other minerals.</li>
<li>Otters are nocturnal.</li>
<li>Crickets are nocturnal.</li>
<li>Rabbits can swim, but don't like doing so.</li>
<li>Bats can swim.</li>
<li>Eagles and bunnies both have 4 toes.</li>
<li>Bunnies cannot turn their head 270 degrees, but they can rotate their ears
    270 degrees, and can rotate each ear independently.</li>
<li>Owls are carnivores, hummingbirds are omnivores, and bats are either
    omnivores or carnivores depending on the species.</li>
<li>Hummingbirds and bats do, in fact, have kidneys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As for the errata, they were issued because:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Thorax is a general term for the chest of an animal, and not an insect-specific term.</li>
<li>We incorrectly assumed that only cats were scared of cucumbers. Turns out wasps are
    repelled by freshly sliced cucumbers, due to the smell they emit, which is
    undetectable by humans.</li>
<li>Although owls are the only animal in the puzzle that can rotate their head
    270 degrees in one direction, we realized the clue was a bit ambiguous,
    because it could also be interpreted as rotating 135 degrees in either direction
    for a total arc of 270 degrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We hope you also learned fun facts about animals while solving this puzzle!
