lists locations within each time zone, and labels each time zone with the military time zone letter for that UTC offset. Solvers must identify each British Empire location, then retrieve the time zone letter for that location.</p>

<p>The final clue's answer is a number instead of a location.
There were 9 former British Dominions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, Ireland, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.
Combined, the cluephrase is "FIGHTER CMDS UBIQUITOUS HAWKER PLANE (9)". This should be read as "RAF Fighter Command's ubiquitous Hawker plane (9)", and the
answer is <strong>HURRICANE</strong>, the name of a Hawker plane that saw heavy use in World War II.</p>

<p>Since Doctor Whooves is based on Doctor Who, a British TV character, I got the idea to do a puzzle about the British Empire and time zones. Since every time zone has an associated letter, and since the British Empire contained territories from almost every time zone, I was able to spell out a cluephrase containing most of the letters of the alphabet. Making the first letters of the clues spell out a cluephrase was sometimes a bit tricky, but it worked out in the end. The answer being a famous British aircraft was also very fitting.</p>
