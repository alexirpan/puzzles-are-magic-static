    <p>The puzzle consists of one large image, one audio file made of 14 five-second audio clips,
    14 smaller pictures with numbers, and some extra information at the end.</p>

    <p>Each audio clip is from a song published by <a href="https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com/">Ponies at Dawn</a>,
    a group that releases compilation albums of songs from the brony music
    community with a pay-what-you-want fee. Proceeds from holiday albums go towards charities,
    and proceeds from other albums go towards the artists. Consider sending something their
    way if you liked their work!</p>

    <p>After poking at the puzzle for a bit, solvers should find the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Every audio clip's song is specifically from
            <a href="https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com/album/recollections">Ponies at Dawn - Recollections</a>,
            whose album cover matches the large image at the top.</li>
        <li>Each of the smaller pictures is a pictionary drawing of a song from
            the audio clip. Colors indicate different words in the title.
    Blue,
    purple, magenta, orange, and green map to the first, second, third,
    fourth, and fifth words of each song respectively.</li>
        <li>The pictionary provided is in alphabetical order.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At this point, there are a few strategies to identifying everything. You
    can search the song lyrics in quotes, which will often turn up the Bandcamp
    page for that song.
    You can solve the pictionary, cross-reference it
    with the list of songs on Recollections, and check it matches an audio
    clip. Or, you can Shazam the music clips, which we didn't expect to work,
    but testsolvers proved us wrong.</p>

    <p>Taking the index provided with each pictionary image, indexing into
    the song name, then ordering based on the given audio gives the next message.</p>

    <p>Reading the first letters of the next lyrics gives "PONYVILLEFMCOM".
    This is a pointer to <a href="https://ponyvillefm.com/">PonyvilleFM</a>,
    a pony radio station that plays pony EDM 24/7. Now the extra information
    should make more sense - it matches the styling of PonyvilleFM's schedule page.
    If we navigate to the full schedule, we see that on the 18th of February,
    at 6 PM UTC, there's an event named "Blue Hedgehog Five with P are M", short for Puzzles are Magic.</p>

    <p>
        Puzzles are Magic isn't actually hosting a PonyvilleFM show on the
        18th, but you
        do want "Blue Hedgehog Five", which is a cluephrase for the answer, <strong>SONIC</strong>.

    <p>"It's a Long Story" was the first puzzle I knew I wanted to make for Puzzles
    Are Magic. This was the 2nd. I knew there was no way this would fly
    in a non-MLP themed hunt, and I wanted to shine a spotlight on the
    lesser-known side of the brony music scene. Many of the most popular brony
    songs are from the 2011-2013 era, but there's plenty of on-going work
    that's more like original music inspired by MLP, rather than remixes of MLP
    songs.
    I hope you enjoyed the deep, narrow dive into pony music.</p>

    <p>Going in, I had the following design goals:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solvers should be able to ID all the songs, even if they've never heard
      any of them. I didn't expect any other puzzlehunters to know what pony
      music was.</li>
        <li>Reverse song lookup shouldn't require digging through tens
            or hundreds of songs, since the search space of "all brony music"
            is surprisingly big, and tools like Shazam can't identify any
            of these songs. (Or so I thought.)</li>
        <li>Listening to the provided audio clips should be necessary to solve the
            puzzle.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The pictionary approach gave a way to figure out song titles without having
    to listen to tons of music, and making the cluephrase come from the next
    word in the song requires listening to the audio clips to figure out where
    they stop. I intended for solvers to rely on pictionary as the main
    ID mechanism, but testsolving showed you really don't need many lyrics
    for Google to find the songs.</p>

    <p>The pictionary was drawn by me in Microsoft Paint, by dragging a computer
    mouse around. I'm not great at art.</p>

    <p>In an earlier draft, the Schedule portion matched <a href="https://ponyvillefm.com/schedule/full">
        PonyvilleFM's full schedule</a> page exactly, including "The next 30 days"
    and "All times are displayed in GMT/UTC". Turns out searches for
    <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=pony+"schedule+the+next+30+days"'>either</a>
    of those <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=pony+"all+times+are+displayed+in+GMT%2FUTC"'>phrases</a>
    with "pony" was enough to find the schedule page! This puzzle's construction
    repeatedly taught me that it's easy to make a sentence of English that's
    never been seen before.</p>

    <p>It's still possible to shortcut directly to the answer, if you recognize
    PonyvilleFM purely from the style of the text, but at that point, you're
    a big enough fan of pony music that you can probably forward-solve without
    much trouble.</p>

    <p>Huge thanks to Squirrel for agreeing to add an event to the PonyvilleFM
    schedule, and for responding so quickly when the PonyvilleFM full schedule
    went down in the middle of hunt. While the site was getting fixed, we redirected solvers to <a href="http://ponyvillelive.com">PonyvilleLive</a>, which shares the same Google Calendar. What, did you think PonyvilleFM was the only pony radio station?</p>

    <p>If you're looking for more pony music, I thought <a href="https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com/album/eternal">Eternal</a> was solid. My favorites are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU7qswjyIhg">Replacer - Pony is Dead, Long Live Pony</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlFQe8KMw_U">Koa - To The Nines</a>,
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXuhkX96n30">AnNy Tr3e - You Are My Star</a>.
    And although they aren't on Eternal, I should give shoutouts to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjQ9zpvOa7k">John Kenza - Love</a>
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYlcT9atIFo">Exiark - Frostfire</a>, for getting me into the Ponies at Dawn catalog.</p>
